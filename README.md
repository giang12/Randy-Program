History
=============
I created this application over spring break in 2012. This is my first Java program. Actually, I learned much more making this program than from class @_@.

I took AP Statistics during my junior year of high school. One day my teacher just RANDOMLY wished she had a tool which could pick out ramdon students in the class to answer her question. I thougt she was big on randomization because she was a typical statistician. So, even though I was new to programming and Java, I took it on as a challenge, and set out to create the tool. I spent my spring break coding, debugging, and banging my head against the laptop; and Randy was born (what a dorky way to spend spring break ^^).
